# Bowling Rules Bug Fixes

## Issues Identified
1. Bowlers could bowl more than 4 overs in a 20-over game
2. Tournament mode was incorrectly set to 50 overs instead of 20 overs
3. Consecutive overs restriction had potential issues

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Max Overs Per Bowler Limit
**File:** `js/game.js`
- Fixed the calculation to ensure no bowler can bowl more than 4 overs in a 20-over game
- Changed from `Math.floor(this.maxOvers / 5)` to `Math.min(4, Math.floor(this.maxOvers / 5))`
- Applied this fix in both the main restriction logic and the rule relaxation section

### 2. Tournament Mode Overs Fix
**File:** `js/game.js`
- Changed `this.maxOvers = 50` to `this.maxOvers = 20` for tournament mode
- This ensures tournament mode follows proper T20 format (20 overs per side)

### 3. Enhanced Consecutive Overs Restriction
**File:** `js/game.js`
- Improved the logic to prevent a bowler from bowling two consecutive overs
- Added safety check to prevent game from breaking if no bowlers are available
- Added better logging for debugging purposes

### 4. Added Debugging and Verification
**File:** `js/game.js`
- Enhanced `updateBowlerStats()` method with detailed logging
- Added verification to check if bowlers exceed max overs
- Added logging in `incrementBall()` to track previous over bowlers
- Added logging in bowler selection to show available bowlers

## Testing
The implementation was tested by:
1. Verifying the max overs calculation correctly limits bowlers to 4 overs
2. Ensuring tournament mode uses 20 overs
3. Checking that consecutive overs restriction works properly
4. Adding console logging to help identify any issues during gameplay

## Verification Logging
Added console logging to help verify:
- Bowler stats updates with overs/balls tracking
- Previous over bowler tracking
- Available bowlers for selection
- Error detection when bowlers exceed max overs
